# What is OIP?

\*\*\*\*[**Open Index Protocol**](https://www.openindexprotocol.com/) \(OIP\) is an open source specification for a persistent worldwide index and file library useful for data publishing, file distribution and facilitating direct payments. 

OIP uses PIN to operate with no central authority: record indexing, file storage/distribution and transaction management are carried out collectively by the decentralized network. OIP is the first **permissionless system** with a decentralized and transparent index for digital content and protected file persistence. 

The system uses a **Salutary Protocol model**, which funnel financial incentive to both application and protocol layers, ensuring sustainability and antifragility of the system through open market incentive alignment of all participants.
