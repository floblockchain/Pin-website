# Welcome to PIN

![](.gitbook/assets/bannerpin.png)

**PIN** is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency designed to save and index metadata to a decentralized, permission less network. 

Its unique features can be used to **"pin"** up to 1040 bytes to any transaction and store it permanently and immutably on the network. The pins can then be retrieved and read by many PIN-based applications. When combined with its supporting metadata library, the [Open Index Protocol \("OIP"\)](https://www.openindexprotocol.com/), **PIN provides a new standard for publishing, indexing, and monetizing any digital content.** 

A **robust development community** is actively using PIN to create and index immutable links that will help to serve as the infrastructure for web3.
